# Community Experiences

This folder collects stories from people who have experimented with how they communicate with AI.

The goal isn't to prove the theory right. It's to gather observations — including ones that contradict or complicate the original idea.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork this repo**

2. **Copy the template**
   
   Copy `template.md` to `experiences/your-name-or-handle.md`

3. **Tell your story**
   
   Fill out the template. Be as specific as you can. Include what didn't work, not just what did.

4. **Submit a pull request**
   
   I'll review and merge contributions that are genuine, specific, and respectful — even (especially) if they disagree with the original theory.

## What Makes a Good Contribution

- **Specificity** — "I changed how I phrase errors and noticed X" beats "I tried being nicer and it worked"
- **Honesty** — Include failures, surprises, and things that didn't match expectations
- **Context** — What domain? What kind of tasks? What AI models?
