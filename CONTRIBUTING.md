# Contributing

This repo exists to explore a question, not defend an answer. Your experiences, pushback, and alternative theories are exactly what this needs.

## Ways to Participate

### Share a Quick Thought

Discussion categories:
- **Your Experiences** — What have you noticed about how communication style affects AI collaboration?
- **Pushback & Challenges** — Where is the theory wrong? What's being overlooked?
- **Techniques That Work** — Specific language, framing, or approaches you've found effective
